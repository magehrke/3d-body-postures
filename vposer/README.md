# 3d-body-postures

This repository contains code which is used to create, display and analyse 3D body postures. 
We are trying to model the fMRI repsonses that humans exhibits when seeing different poses.

This is a project at Maastricht University and the code is proprietary except reused code that
holds it's original licence. We use [vposer](https://github.com/nghorbani/human_body_prior) to create the body postures and
[tikreg](https://github.com/gallantlab/tikreg) to help us train a model.
